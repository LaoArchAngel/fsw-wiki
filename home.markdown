# FSW Development Wiki
**Welcome!** To the new FSW Development Wiki.  This will be where you will find
most of our process and technology documentation.  This wiki can be edited by
anyone who is at least a [Developer](http://gitlab.fsw.com/help/permissions/permissions)
in the [FSW Group](http://gitlab.fsw.com/groups/tfs/members).

This wiki is one of our many efforts in keeping a centralized document area that
can be quickly updated by anyone in the department.  As such, if you have write-access
and you notice something is out of date, please lend a hand and update it.

This page will be dedicated to helping you make changes to the wiki, as well as
a starting point for all of our most important sections of the documentation.

## Editing the Wiki
**_IMPORTANT!_** In order to edit the wiki, please go over the
[Gitlab Markdown Documentation](http://gitlab.fsw.com/help/markdown/markdown).
I highly recommend that you keep that window open while you edit

Editing the wiki is very straight-forward.  You can edit any page in the Wiki by
clicking on the Edit button located at the top of the page.

If you are in a page and you know that a new page has to be created that links to
the one you're currently on, you can simply create a link.

If you would just like to create a new page that is not linked anywhere but is instead
found under the [Pages](http://gitlab.fsw.com/tfs/library/wikis/pages) tab of the
wiki, click the [+ New Page](http://gitlab.fsw.com/tfs/library/wikis/home#modal-new-wiki)
button located at the top of the wiki.

Always remember to add a commit message regarding the changes you made at the bottom of the page before saving changes.

If you would like to add an image to a page, you can simply drag-and-drop, or otherwise
click on the attaching link at the bottom of the **Content** pane.
