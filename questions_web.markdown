#### Q: If you are building a form on a site, such as a form that takes a user’s address, do you think validation should happen on the client or the server side?

#### A: Both.

Client-side because it means a more responsive user experience and less chatter over the wire
* A good answer here indicates decent UI or usability skills
* If client-side is not mentioned, they may not have much web or JS experience

Server-side because code should never trust that a client has validated input (security).  Some validation also requires complex validation like asserting that a city matches a zip code, which is impractical to do client-side.
* A good answer here indicates solid coding fundamentals and at least rudimentary focus on security.
* If server-side is not mentioned, they may be more of a JS/HTML developer than a full-stack

#### Follow-Ups:
* Ask them “Why?” if they don’t give much explanation
* If they only give one, ask if they see a downside to only focusing on that type.  That should guide them towards thinking about both.
