Explanation below:

After discussions with the dev team lead and the architecture guilds, we’ve decided to attempt to distribute the architecture team’s role as real-time Q&A/support by introducing the concept of Technology Specialists and scaling this responsibility out to the entire tech organization in the direction of a `community support` model.
 
We are doing this because escalating to the architecture team, alone, does not scale and because the voice from you all seems to favor “Deliver us architectural components and tools” over “Help me get un-stuck”.  By sharing the responsibility of answering direct questions with the full tech department, the arch team will be able to deliver needed components in a more timely fashion.

It is important to note that we are not trying to stop the conversations that have traditionally occurred.  Instead we want to broaden the participation in these conversation to include anyone who is able to help.  Architecture should absolutely be included in these conversations but the expectation should change such that responses will come from anyone.  Let’s see if we can build up a community of support involving developers, leads, subject matter experts, and architects.
