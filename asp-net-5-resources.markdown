Microsoft has committed to making ASP.NET leaner, more modular, cross-platform, and cloud optimized.  The next version of of ASP.NET is an open source web framework that can be developed and run on Windows, Linux and the Mac. It includes the MVC 6 framework, which now combines the features of MVC and Web API into a single web programming framework. 

With ASP.NET 5, Microsoft is making a number of architectural changes that makes the core web framework much leaner (it no longer requires System.Web.dll) and more modular (almost all features are now implemented as NuGet modules - allowing you to optimize your app to have just what you need).  Microsoft is targeting the following foundational improvements:

* Build and run cross-platform ASP.NET apps on Windows, Mac and Linux
* Built on .NET Core, which supports true side-by-side app versioning
* New tooling that simplifies modern Web development
* Single aligned web stack for Web UI and Web APIs
* Cloud-ready environment-based configuration
* Integrated support for creating and using NuGet packages
* Built-in support for dependency injection
* Ability to host on IIS or self-host in your own process
