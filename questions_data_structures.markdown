#### Q: How would you store a list of phone numbers for fast retrieval, like check whether the phone number exists?
#### A:
Use a hastable for storing all phone numbers. This would give us constant time lookup of phone numbers.

##### Q: How would you optimize it for space/storage?
##### A:
Use a tree to store all phone numbers, each digit would be a node in the tree

##### Q: How does that affect performance?
##### A:
Using a tree change the performance to log(10) assuming all phone numbers are 10 digits long, which would still be constant time.

#### Q: How do hashtables work?
#### A:

#### Q: Implement a hashtable?
#### A: 

#### Q: Given an array and a product (or sum), please implement a function that finds to numbers in the array whose product (or sum) is the provided value.
#### A: 

#### Q: Implement a min-stack?
#### A:

#### Q: Cleanup file path (UNIX or Windows)? "/home/.././home/./indianajones/../margaret/." must be cleaned up to "/home/margaret", for windows you may assume that the drive letter has been removed and your procedure was passed "\\home\\..\\.\\home\\.\\indianajones\\..\\margaret\\." and it should return "\\home\\margaret".
#### A:
